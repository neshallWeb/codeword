1. What are the rules of Codewords?
The rules of codewords are to work out which number represents each letter from A - Z in the grid.

You then must go through the grid and replace each instance of a number with the letter that it represents, once you've worked it out.

Thus if you know that 12 = E, then go through and write an E in for each instance of 12, and remember to cross off E on the letter grid underneath so you know it is placed.

Often you will be given some starter letters, so place these first.

2. What strategy tips will help me solve Codewords puzzles?
Look for the numbers that occur most frequently in the puzzle and use basic frequency analysis to realize that these are probably the E, T, and A in other words they correspond to the most common letters in the English language.

Use the given letters and fill these in and concentrate on seeing if they can be used to help you place any words and therefore other letters.

Cross off from A - Z as you go through so you can easily see at a glance what else you have to place.
